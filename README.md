## ‚öôÔ∏è Auto-Update Configuration

The auto-update system works by:

1. **Daily monitoring** of the official Aegisum core repository
2. **Commit comparison** to detect new changes
3. **Automatic building** when updates are found
4. **Release creation** with professional DMG installers
5. **Build tracking** to prevent unnecessary rebuilds

### Manual Trigger Options

You can manually trigger builds with these options:

* **Force Build** - Build even if no updates are detected
* **Create Release** - Generate a GitHub release with the build artifacts
* **Skip Release** - Build artifacts only (no public release)

## üîÑ Integration with Official Repository

To integrate this build system into your official Aegisum repository:

### Step 1: Repository Setup
```bash
# Add this repository as a submodule or copy the files
cp build_aegisum_macos.sh /path/to/official/repo/
cp -r .github/workflows/ /path/to/official/repo/.github/
```

### Step 2: GitHub Secrets (if needed)
If you need custom tokens or signing certificates:
```bash
# In your repository settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here  # Usually automatic
APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID=your_id    # For code signing (optional)
```

### Step 3: Workflow Customization
Edit `.github/workflows/auto-build.yml` to customize:
* Build schedule (currently daily at 6 AM UTC)
* Repository URLs
* Release naming conventions
* Notification settings

### Step 4: Developer Instructions
Send this to your developer for integration:

```markdown
## Integration Instructions for Developer

1. Copy the build system files to the official repository:
   - `build_aegisum_macos.sh` (main build script)
   - `.github/workflows/auto-build.yml` (GitHub Actions workflow)

2. Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled in repository settings

3. The system will automatically:
   - Monitor for Aegisum core updates daily
   - Build and release new DMG files when updates are detected
