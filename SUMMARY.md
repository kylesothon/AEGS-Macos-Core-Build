# ðŸŽ‰ Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Compiler - Project Summary

## What Was Accomplished

I have successfully created your own professional version of the Aegisum Qt Core wallet compilation script with comprehensive auto-update functionality. Here's what was delivered:

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **Created Professional Build System**
- âœ… **Completely rewritten** the build script as `build_aegisum_macos.sh`
- âœ… **Professional branding** as "Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Compiler"
- âœ… **Enhanced error handling** and user experience
- âœ… **Universal compatibility** for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

### 2. **Implemented Auto-Update Functionality**
- âœ… **Daily monitoring** of Aegisum core repository (6 AM UTC)
- âœ… **Automatic builds** when new commits are detected
- âœ… **Smart tracking** via `last_built_commit.txt` to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
- âœ… **Manual trigger options** with force-build capability

### 3. **GitHub Actions Integration**
- âœ… **Professional CI/CD pipeline** in `.github/workflows/auto-build.yml`
- âœ… **Automated release creation** with professional DMG files
- âœ… **Build verification** and artifact management
- âœ… **Professional release notes** generation

### 4. **Removed Old System**
- âœ… **Deleted** old `aegs-build-scripts-main-9/` directory
- âœ… **Removed** old `build.yml` workflow
- âœ… **Consolidated** into single professional system

### 5. **Professional Documentation**
- âœ… **Comprehensive README.md** with full feature documentation
- âœ… **Developer integration guide** (`INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
- âœ… **Testing script** (`test_build.sh`) for validation
- âœ… **Step-by-step instructions** for your developer

## ðŸš€ How to Use the New System

### For Automated Builds (Recommended)
1. **Merge the pull request** I created: https://github.com/kylesothon/AEGS-Macos-Core-Build/pull/1
2. **Go to Actions tab** in your GitHub repository
3. **Click "Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Auto-Builder"**
4. **Click "Run workflow"** and enable "Force build" for first test
5. **Download DMG** from the generated release

### For Manual Local Builds
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/kylesothon/AEGS-Macos-Core-Build.git
cd AEGS-Macos-Core-Build

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout official-aegisum-macos-compiler

# Test the system (macOS only)
./test_build.sh

# Run the build (macOS only)
./build_aegisum_macos.sh
```

## ðŸ”„ Auto-Update System Explained

The auto-update system works by:

1. **Daily Check**: Every day at 6 AM UTC, GitHub Actions runs automatically
2. **Commit Comparison**: Compares latest Aegisum core commit with last built commit
3. **Conditional Build**: Only builds if new commits are detected
4. **Professional Release**: Creates GitHub release with DMG installer
5. **Tracking Update**: Records the built commit to prevent rebuilds

### Manual Control Options
- **Force Build**: Build even if no updates available
- **Create Release**: Generate public release (default: true)
- **Skip Release**: Build artifacts only for testing

## ðŸ“‹ Integration Instructions for Your Developer

Send this to your developer for integration into the official Aegisum repository:

### Quick Integration Steps:
1. **Copy these files** to the official repository:
   - `build_aegisum_macos.sh` (main build script)
   - `.github/workflows/auto-build.yml` (GitHub Actions workflow)
   - `last_built_commit.txt` (build tracking)
   - `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (detailed instructions)

2. **Enable GitHub Actions** in repository settings

3. **Set workflow permissions** to "Read and write permissions"

4. **Test with manual trigger** from Actions tab

5. **Update repository README** to mention macOS builds

### Detailed Instructions
See `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive step-by-step integration instructions.
