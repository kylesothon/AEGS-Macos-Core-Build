## 🎯 For Your Developer: How to Add This to Official Aegisum Repository

Send this guide to your developer to integrate the build system into your official Aegisum GitHub repository.

## 📋 Integration Steps

### Step 1: Copy Build System Files
Copy these files from this repository to your official Aegisum repository:

```bash
# Essential files to copy:
build_aegisum_macos.sh                    # Main build script
.github/workflows/auto-build.yml          # GitHub Actions workflow
README.md                                 # Documentation (optional)
HOW_TO_DOWNLOAD_DMG.md                   # User guide (optional)
```

### Step 2: Repository Structure
Place files in your official repository like this:
```
your-official-aegisum-repo/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── auto-build.yml              # ← Copy this
├── build_aegisum_macos.sh              # ← Copy this
├── README.md                           # ← Update or merge
└── (your existing Aegisum core files)
```

### Step 3: Workflow Configuration
Edit `.github/workflows/auto-build.yml` and update these lines:

```yaml
# Line 15: Update repository URL
AEGISUM_REPO: "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-AEGISUM-REPO.git"

# Line 35: Update repository reference  
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-AEGISUM-REPO.git aegisum
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Actions
1. **Go to your repository Settings**
2. **Click "Actions" in the left sidebar**
3. **Select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 5: Test the Integration
1. **Go to Actions tab** in your repository
2. **Click "Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Auto-Builder"**
3. **Click "Run workflow"**
4. **Enable "Force build"** for testing
5. **Click "Run workflow"** button
6. **Wait 10-12 minutes** for completion
7. **Verify artifacts are created**

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Build Schedule
The workflow runs daily at 6:50 AM UTC. To change this, edit line 6 in `auto-build.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '50 6 * * *'  # Change this time as needed
```

### Repository Monitoring
The system monitors your main Aegisum repository for updates. To change the monitored repository, update line 15:
```yaml
AEGISUM_REPO: "https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO.git"
```

### Artifact Retention
Artifacts are kept for 30 days. To change this, edit line 89:
```yaml
retention-days: 30  # Change as needed
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### No Secrets Required
- **GitHub token is automatic** - no setup needed
- **No API keys required** - everything uses public repositories
- **No signing certificates needed** - builds work without code signing

### Optional Enhancements
If you want to add code signing later:
```yaml
# Add to repository secrets:
APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID: "Your Apple Developer ID"
APPLE_CERTIFICATE: "Base64 encoded certificate"
```

## 📊 What Happens After Integration

### Automatic Daily Builds
- **Every day at 6:50 AM UTC**, the system checks for new commits
- **If changes are found**, a new build is triggered automatically
- **DMG files are created** and stored as artifacts
- **Build history is tracked** to prevent unnecessary rebuilds

### Manual Builds
- **Repository maintainers** can trigger builds anytime
- **Force build option** rebuilds even without changes
- **Artifacts are available** for 30 days after each build

### User Experience
- **Users can download** ready-built DMG files from Actions tab
- **Professional installers** with drag-and-drop interface
- **Universal compatibility** for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- **No technical knowledge required** for end users

## 🚀 Benefits for Your Project

### Professional Distribution
- ✅ **Native macOS app bundles** with proper integration
- ✅ **Professional DMG installers** ready for distribution
- ✅ **Automatic updates** when your core code changes
- ✅ **Zero maintenance** once integrated

### Developer Workflow

## 📞 Support

### If Issues Occur
1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify repository URLs** are correct in the workflow
3. **Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled** in repository settings
4. **Test with manual workflow trigger** first

### Common Fixes
- **Build failures**: Usually dependency or source code issues
- **Workflow not running**: Check GitHub Actions permissions
- **Artifact not created**: Review build logs for errors
