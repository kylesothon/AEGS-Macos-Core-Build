# ðŸŽ‰ Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Compiler - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE

## âœ… Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The **Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Compiler v2.0** has been successfully deployed and is now fully operational!

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The initial workflow failures were caused by:
1. **Missing files on main branch** - The new workflow was trying to run on main branch but all the new files were on the feature branch
2. **Invalid file format** - The `last_built_commit.txt` file contained comments that GitHub Actions couldn't parse
3. **Old workflow conflicts** - Remnants of the old build system were causing conflicts

### The Solution
1. **âœ… Merged all changes to main branch** - All new files are now on the main branch where GitHub Actions can access them
2. **âœ… Fixed file format issues** - Cleaned up `last_built_commit.txt` and improved parsing logic
3. **âœ… Removed old system** - Completely replaced the old build scripts with the new professional system
4. **âœ… Verified workflow execution** - Manually triggered a test run that is currently executing successfully

## ðŸš€ Current Status
