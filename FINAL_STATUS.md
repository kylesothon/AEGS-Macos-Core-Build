# ðŸŽ‰ Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Compiler - DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE

## ðŸ”§ Status: FIXING BUILD ISSUES

The **Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Compiler v2.0** deployment is in progress. We've identified and are fixing build compatibility issues.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### Round 1: Workflow Setup Issues âœ… FIXED
1. **Missing files on main branch** - The new workflow was trying to run on main branch but all the new files were on the feature branch
2. **Invalid file format** - The `last_built_commit.txt` file contained comments that GitHub Actions couldn't parse
3. **Old workflow conflicts** - Remnants of the old build system were causing conflicts

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **âœ… Merged all changes to main branch** - All new files are now on the main branch where GitHub Actions can access them
2. **âœ… Fixed file format issues** - Cleaned up `last_built_commit.txt` and improved parsing logic
3. **âœ… Removed old system** - Completely replaced the old build scripts with the new professional system

#### Round 2: Boost Filesystem API Compatibility Issue ðŸ”§ FIXING
**Problem:** Build failing with Boost filesystem API errors:
```
error: no member named 'copy_option' in namespace 'boost::filesystem'
error: no member named 'overwrite_if_exists' in 'boost::filesystem::copy_options'
```

**Root Cause:** The patch was looking for `wallet/bdb.cpp` but the actual file is at `src/wallet/bdb.cpp`

**Solution Applied:**
1. **âœ… Fixed file path** - Corrected patch to target `src/wallet/bdb.cpp`
2. **âœ… Added error handling** - Added warning when patch file is not found
3. **ðŸ”§ Testing** - New build running with fix (Workflow ID: 16085115160)

## ðŸš€ Current Status

### ðŸ”§ Active Workflow (Testing Fix)
- **Workflow ID**: 16085115160
- **Status**: ðŸ”§ Running with Boost filesystem fix
- **Branch**: main
- **Trigger**: Manual (force build)
- **Started**: 2025-07-05 05:49:05 UTC
- **Fix Applied**: Corrected Boost filesystem API patch file path

### âœ… System Components
- **Build Script**: `build_aegisum_macos.sh` âœ… Active
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/auto-build.yml` âœ… Active

3. **Professional Releases**: Creates GitHub releases with professional DMG files
4. **Build Tracking**: Tracks what was built to prevent duplicates

### Manual Control
You can manually trigger builds anytime by:
1. Going to the **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Selecting **"Official Aegisum macOS Core Wallet Auto-Builder"**
3. Clicking **"Run workflow"**
4. Optionally enabling **"Force build"** to build even without updates
